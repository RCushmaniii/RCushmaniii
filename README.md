I design and build AI-assisted web applications using LLMs and modern web stacks — focused on practical products that real businesses can actually use.

This work is part of **CushLabs.ai** — my AI product studio focused on building calm, practical AI tools with LLMs and modern web stacks.

---

## Background
I’ve spent decades working in enterprise IT and consulting — managing infrastructure at scale, building internal systems, and supporting teams and executives in high-stakes environments.

That experience now informs how I approach modern stacks: React, TypeScript, Python, AI APIs, and serverless platforms — with an emphasis on durability, clarity, and long-term maintainability.

---

## What I do
- Design and build AI-assisted web applications powered by LLMs  
- Implement practical AI features (analysis, search, assistants, copilots)  
- Ship production-ready apps with React, TypeScript, and Python  
- Explore modern AI tooling and share learnings through open-source projects  

---

## Why work with me
I’ve debugged enterprise systems at 3 a.m. *and* explained technical trade-offs to C-suite leaders. I know how to build systems that don’t fall apart — and how to translate AI buzzwords into clear, usable products.

---

## Philosophy
I focus on building AI-assisted systems that are understandable, maintainable, and genuinely useful — not demos held together by prompts.

I believe good AI products:
- Respect human judgment instead of replacing it  
- Favor clarity over cleverness  
- Ship small, real value early  
- Age well as models, tools, and APIs change  

Most of my work lives at the intersection of LLM capability, UX clarity, and business reality.
