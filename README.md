## Hey, I'm Robert 👋

**Full-Stack Developer • AI Solutions Architect**  
Guadalajara, Mexico 🇲🇽

I build AI-powered web applications for businesses that require modern solutions without the complexity of enterprise systems.

**Background:** 25 years in enterprise IT (managed infrastructure for 26K employees, built custom SharePoint/.NET systems, traveled as IT consultant). Now I'm applying that architecture experience to a modern stack: React, Python, AI APIs, and serverless platforms.

**What I do:**
- Help SMBs integrate AI into their workflows (automation, customer tools, data analysis)
- Build production-ready web apps with React, TypeScript, and Python
- Experiment with AI agents, modern frameworks, and developer tools
- Share what I'm learning through open-source projects

**Why work with me:**  
I've debugged enterprise systems at 3 am and explained technical decisions to C-suite execs. I know how to build things that don't break, and I can translate "AI buzzwords" into actual business value.
