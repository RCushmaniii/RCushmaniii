## Overview

I design and build **AI-assisted web applications** using LLMs and modern web stacks — focused on **practical, production-ready products** that real businesses can actually use.

This work is part of **CushLabs.ai**, my independent AI product studio focused on building **calm, durable AI systems** that prioritize clarity, maintainability, and real-world value over demos and hype.

I help organizations move from *AI curiosity* to *usable systems*.

---

## Background

I bring **17+ years of experience in enterprise IT and consulting**, including time as an **IT Manager at a Fortune 100 company**, where I supported large-scale infrastructure, internal platforms, and executive stakeholders in high-stakes environments.

I’ve managed systems that had to stay online, explained technical trade-offs to non-technical leaders, and made decisions with long-term operational consequences.

That background directly informs how I approach modern development today:
- clear architecture
- disciplined scope
- production-first thinking
- systems that age well as tools and models evolve

## What I Do

I work at the intersection of **AI capability, UX clarity, and business reality**.

- Design and build AI-assisted web applications powered by LLMs  
- Implement practical AI features (analysis, search, assistants, copilots)  
- Ship production-ready systems using React, TypeScript, and Python  
- Architect solutions that balance speed, reliability, and maintainability  
- Explore modern AI tooling and share learnings through open-source projects  

My focus is not “AI for its own sake,” but **AI that supports human judgment and real workflows**.

---

## Why Work With Me

I’m not new to complex systems — I’m new to *applying modern AI tooling responsibly*.

I’ve:
- debugged enterprise systems at 3 a.m.
- supported executives during critical decisions
- owned systems long after the initial build
- seen what breaks when projects prioritize speed over clarity

That experience allows me to translate AI buzzwords into **clear, usable products** that teams can actually operate and maintain.

Clients work with me when they want:
- thoughtful architecture, not fragile demos  
- clear communication, not jargon  
- delivery discipline, not experimentation without ownership  

---

## Philosophy

I focus on building AI-assisted systems that are **understandable, maintainable, and genuinely useful** — not products held together by prompts.

I believe good AI products:

- Respect human judgment instead of replacing it  
- Favor clarity over cleverness  
- Deliver small, real value early  
- Age well as models, tools, and APIs change  

Most of my work lives where **technical capability meets practical restraint**.
